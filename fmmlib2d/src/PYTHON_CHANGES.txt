On MAC OSX, line 24 of second-r8.f throws an error on importing the compiled .so file.  I have commented this line out.

On lines 267-270 of hfmm2dpart.f, changed:

        real *8 target(2,1)
        complex *16 pottarg(1)
        complex *16 gradtarg(2,1)
        complex *16 hesstarg(3,1)

To:

        real *8 target(2,*)
        complex *16 pottarg(*)
        complex *16 gradtarg(2,*)        
        complex *16 hesstarg(3,*)

(this makes no real difference in Fortran but f2py gets grumpy about it)

Made changes to hfmm2dpart.f to allow fast computation of modified laplace kernels,
See the file
