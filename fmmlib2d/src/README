Helmholtz particle FMMs in R^2.
===============================

hfmm2d: charge and dipstr are complex valued, x \in R^2

\phi(x_i) = (ima/4) \sum_{j\ne i}   charge_j H^{(1)}_0(k |x_i-x_j| )
            + dipstr_j (dipvec_j \dot \grad_j H^{(1)}_0(k |x_i-x_j| )

or, more precisely,

\phi(x_i) = (ima/4) \sum_{j\ne i}   charge_j H^{(1)}_0(k |x_i-x_j| )
+ dipstr_j (dipvec_j \dot (x_i-x_j) ) H^{(1)}_1(k |x_i-x_j|) *k/|x_i-x_j|


Laplace particle FMMs in R^2.
=============================

lfmm2d: charge and dipstr are complex valued, x \in R^2

\phi(x_i) = \sum_{j\ne i}   charge_j \log |x_i-x_j|  
                   + dipstr_j (dipvec_j \dot \grad_j log|x_i-x_j|)

or, more precisely, 

\phi(x_i) = \sum_{j\ne i}   charge_j \log |x_i-x_j|  
                   + dipstr_j (dipvec_j \dot (x_i-x_j)) * (-1/|x_i-x_j|^2)


rfmm2d: charge and dipstr are real valued, x \in R^2

\phi(x_i) = \sum_{j\ne i}   charge_j \log |x_i-x_j| 
                   + dipstr_j (dipvec_j \dot \grad_j log|x_i-x_j|)

or, more precisely,

\phi(x_i) = \sum_{j\ne i}   charge_j \log |x_i-x_j|  
                   + dipstr_j (dipvec_j \dot (x_i-x_j)) * (-1/|x_i-x_j|^2)


cfmm2d: charge and dipstr are complex valued, z are complex numbers.

       Note, that the complex valued logarithm is a multi-valued
       function, so the potential values have to be interpreted
       carefully, if charges are specified.  For example, only the
       real part of potential is meaningful for real valued charges.
       The gradients and hessians are valid for arbitrary complex charges.

\phi(z_i) = \sum_{j\ne i} charge_j \log(z_i-z_j) + dipstr_j \frac{1}{z_i-z_j}

       In this routine, we define the gradient as the first
       derivative with respect to z, and the hessian as the second
       derivative with respect to z.

\gradient \phi(z_i) = \frac{\partial \phi(z_i)}{\partial z}
\hessian  \phi(z_i) = \frac{\partial^2 \phi(z_i)}{\partial z^2}



Warning, the direct evaluation routines are different for cfmm2d,
rfmm2d and lfmm2d, respectively.

cfmm2d - cpotgrad2d_sdp  - cfmm2dpart.f

rfmm2d - rpotgrad2d_sdp  - rfmm2dpart.f

lfmm2d - rcpotgrad2d_sdp - lfmm2dpart.f


The lfmm2d is the closest analog for hfmm2d, i.e. it implements
complex valued charges and dipoles. rfmm2d is the real version of
lfmm2d, it is slightly faster (2x) but can handle only real valued charges
and dipoles. cfmm2d does the Cauchy type sums of complex valued
charges and dipoles - dipole vectors have no meaning in cfmm2d.

Both rfmm2d and lfmm2d will internally form real charges and complex
dipoles (lfmm2d does it twice), after that the actual work is
performed by cfmm2d.

Helmholtz dipole potential:

   (dipvec(1)*xdiff+dipvec(2)*ydiff) * (h1*wavek/r) * (ima/4)

Laplace dipole potential:

   (dipvec(1)*xdiff+dipvec(2)*ydiff) * (-1/r**2)


Note the sign flip in the Laplace dipole potential, this is due to our Green's
function choice as log(r).
